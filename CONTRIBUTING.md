This project may change its open-source license in the future (becoming more permissive or more restrictive), so please be aware of this. Any contributed code will be considered as agreement to this action.

Postscript from the author dcsuibian: I hope this project uses as permissive a license as possible (e.g., MIT). However, since this project heavily references the source code of Redis 7.0 and earlier versions, it maintains the same license as Redis.
